Why the role assignment?
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a crucial security feature for any application,
allowing you to assign different levels of access to users based on their roles. 
It simplifies the management of user rights and privileges, especially when the number 
of users grows. Hereâ€™s why RBAC is essential:
- Security: RBAC ensures that users only access resources necessary for their roles.
- Scalability: Easily add more roles as your application grows.
- Maintainability: Easier to manage user permissions and roles across a large team.
#The roles used was simplied to follow the principle of least privilege, which ensures 
#that users only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
